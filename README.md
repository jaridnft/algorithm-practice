>Data Structures? They're here.  Algorithms?  Covered.  Lots of questions with well-explained solutions?  Yep!
>
>If you're nervous about your first coding interview, or anxious about applying to your next job, this is the course for you.  I got tired of interviewers asking tricky questions that can only be answered if you've seen the problem before, so I made this course!  This video course will teach you the most common interview questions that you'll see in a coding interview, giving you the tools you need to ace your next whiteboard interview.

>Coding interviews are notoriously intimidating, but there is one method to become a better interviewer - and that is practice!  Practicing dozens of interview questions is what makes the difference between a job offer for a $120k USD and another rejection email.  This course is going to not only give you dozens of questions to practice on, but it will also make sure you understand the tricks behind solving each question, so youâ€™ll be able to perform in a real interview.
